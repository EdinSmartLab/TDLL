# TDLL: Tiny Deep Learning Library

Solution code for the machine-learning exercises of the 2018 class of High Performance Computing for Science and Engineering (HPCSE) at ETH Zurich.  
Refer to the class website (as long as it is available) for the tutorial slides and exercise explanation (exercises 6 and 7): http://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/teaching/hpcse-i_hs18/


This code requires a good C++ compiler and BLAS implementation. I assume that You will be able to edit the GNU Makefile to compile the code. After all, if this were not the case, why would You be playing with this C++ code instead of one of the popular Python APIs?
